## Problems
 1. Parse the data file used in [The Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/upshot/where-are-the-hardest-places-to-live-in-the-us.html) and reproduce their figure.
 2. Recreate the map using your own style.
 3. Investigate correlations across different metrics.
 4. Are highly-ranked counties more or less spatially clustered than lower-ranked counties?
 5. Find a different dataset that, coupled with the county data, could help answer other
    interesting questions. Possible themes: social mobility, electric vehicles, social media.
